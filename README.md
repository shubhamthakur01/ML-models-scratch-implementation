## ML-models-scratch-implementation

Here we implemented popular machine learning algorithm from scratch. We tried to add functionality similar to sklearn. Following are the algorithm we implemented:

1. Adaboost
2. Decision Tree
3. Gradient Boosting
4. Naive Bayes
5. Random Forest
6. Ridge Regression
